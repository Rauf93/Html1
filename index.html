    <h1>HISTORY OF HTML</h1>
    <p>
      Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland
      invented HTML in 1991. This first version consisted of 18 HTML tages. Now,
      there are currently about 140 HTML tags, although not all of them are
      supported by modern browsers. Learn more about Tim Berners-Lee here:

    <h3>The Timline of HTML</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1991</strong>- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1993</strong>- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are
        creating websites at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1995</strong>- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features
        of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup
        language for designing and creating websites until 1997.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1997</strong>- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett
        introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML
        and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing
        websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser
        in applying further improvements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1999</strong>- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very
        successful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2014</strong>- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is
        said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in
        2012.

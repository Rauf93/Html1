      Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 and grew up in London. He studied
      physics at Oxford University and later became a software engineer.
      Berners-Lee first described the concept of a global system, based on the
      concept of вЂhypertext which would allow researchers everywhere to share
      information in 1980. He built a prototype called вЂEnquireвЂ™. In 1984, he
      published a paper called вЂInformation Management: A ProposalвЂ™ in which
      he created a system for sharing and distributing information globally. He
      named it the World Wide Web. First website was created in 1991. You can

      World Wide Web Consortium at the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at
      the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. Currently, he is
      director of the World Wide Web Consortium that he founded and a Professor
      in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford.
